XMLTV grabber for sledovanitv.cz
================================


Installation
------------
You need XMLTV, LWP, File::Slurp, Log::TraceMessages and JSON perl modules,
which are not part of the default perl installation, but they will be
probably installed as dependencies when you install XMLTV. If not install
them manually from CPAN or your distribution package pool.

Place tv_grab_cz_sledovanitv somewhere in your $PATH. Most XMLTV apps search
$PATH for tv_grab_* programs when looking for grabbers. Be sure the file is
executable.


Configuration
-------------
Use any XMLTV GUI to configure the grabber. You can also use:
  tv_grab_cz_sledovanitv --configure
from the command line.


Further information
-------------------
Run
  tv_grab_cz_sledovanitv --help
or read about grabbers on XMLTV wiki to get more information.
